## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

**Version 2.0 - Educational Release**

This scanner is designed for **learning and educational purposes only**. It demonstrates vulnerability scanning concepts but has limitations:

- Estimated 10-15% false positive rate on SSRF detection
- Not suitable for production bug bounty hunting
- Use Burp Suite Professional for real security testing
- Best used on authorized test applications only

### Why This Tool vs Professional Alternatives

This project is ideal for:
- Learning how vulnerability scanners work
- Understanding web security concepts
- Portfolio/GitHub project demonstration
- Personal security testing on your own apps

**For professional bug bounty hunting, use:**
- Burp Suite Professional
- OWASP ZAP
- Nuclei with custom templates

### Current Limitations

- SSRF detection relies on response analysis (prone to false positives)
- No authentication handling
- No session management
- Limited to HTTP GET requests
- No JavaScript execution
- No WAF evasion

This tool was built as an educational project to understand security scanning principles.
